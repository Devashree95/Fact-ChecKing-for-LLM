# Fact-ChecKing-for-LLM

# Introduction:<br>
Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into educational system. They offer scalable and adptive learning solutions. But some times, LLMs can generate inaccurate and misleading information. This is particularly concerning for educational settings. We have implemented a fact checking system for educational content using RAG(Retrival Augmented Generation) technique. Our project follows following methodology:

This project is divided in 2 parts:  
1. Doc2Vec
2. BERT

Same data can be used as knowledge source for both of these parts.  

# 1) Data load:<br>
We used the 9 books stoed at following location and a web URL as our knowledge source. You can download these books in order to run the data load script:
